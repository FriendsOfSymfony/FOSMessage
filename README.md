FOSMessage is a PHP 5.4+ framework-agnostic library providing a data structure
and common features to set up user-to-user messaging systems.

You can think of it as a model for your messaging features : it will take care of the consistency
of the data for you in order to easily create a full-featured messaging system.

> *Note* : This library is currently in development. You can test it in your project
> (the Composer installation process is very simple), but you should not use it in production
> for the moment.

This library is based on concepts shared by most modern frameworks (dependency injection,
event dispatching, abstract data drivers, etc.) and therefore, itâ€™s very easy to set it up in any
kind of context.

If you want to set it up in Symfony, *FOSMesageBundle* is being developed in a new version
(not ready yet).
