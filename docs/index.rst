FOSMessage
==========

FOSMessage is a PHP 5.4+ framework-agnostic library providing a data structure
and common features to set up user-to-user messaging systems.

You can think of it as a model for your messaging features : it will take care
of the consistency of your data for you in order to create easily a full-featured
messaging system.

For instance, here are some examples of what you could create with the library:

- a chat system between your website users ;
- a notifications system to alert your users ;
- a discussions system based on e-mails (receive and send e-mails as messages) ;

This library is based on concepts shared by most modern frameworks (dependency injection,
event dispatching, abstract data drivers, etc.) and therefore, it's very easy to set it up
in any kind of context.

If you want to set it up in Symfony, take a look at *FOSMessageBundle* (not ready yet).
